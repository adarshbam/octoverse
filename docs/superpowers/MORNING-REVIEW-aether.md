# Aether overnight build: morning review list

Branch: `claude/aether-world-overnight`. Nothing pushed, nothing merged. Frame rates are "under load" (three sessions share one Intel UHD).

## PENDING OWNER REVIEW

_(none yet; the build is gated on E02 and Veyra landings)_

## Placeholder names for the five unnamed P3/P4 icons

Spec 7.10 does not ship these until named. Overnight stand-ins, used only in the 15-technology test set (P3 stills, overview perf run):
1. Atom mark: "Atom"
2. Golden block mark: "Block"
3. White animal mascot: "Mascot"
4. Gold-and-violet mark: "Spark"
5. Vite "V": "Vite"

Please give the real names.

## Engine follow-ups for the engine owner

- **Title icon.** The engine's `validateBundle` only accepts `titleIcon` `'flame'` (`src/engine/ui/titleIcons.ts`, red artwork). Aether needs `'ringedPlanet'` (spec 7.10; no red, spec 7.7). Until the engine gains it, Aether's intro title shows the red flame. `src/worlds/aether/bundle.test.ts` pins the stopgap (`titleIcon === 'flame'`); that test failing is the cue to switch the theme.
- **Empty orbit shells.** `layoutOrbits` (`artifacts/bubbleOrbits.ts`) crashes on `shells: []` (`i % 0`); Aether's placeholder uses one zero-radius shell with size 0 until Task 5.
- **Kit stubs.** `Kit.tsx` requires `chain` and `chain_lod1` nodes even when the layout has no chains.
- **Logo marks.** `LOGO_SLUGS` has no mark for OpenAI, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, AWS or Vector DB (lettered fallback).

## Questions for the owner (Task 4, face)

- Catchlights: spec 2.3 says "large upper, small lower". Aether's panels P2, P3 and P4 at 3x paint both upper right, so the face follows the panels. Say if you want the spec reading (one-line change).
- `happy` (overview face) was tuned to P3 to `mouthCurve 0.75, mouthOpen 0.35, blush 0.4` (engine base is 0.8 / 0.6). Unrequested; veto if you prefer the base.
- The open "wonder" mouth reads as a V/U with a small tongue, not P4's D-shaped mouth. This is an engine limit (the open mouth keeps the closed smile's curved top, the tongue is a fixed shape). Fixing it needs an engine change; say if you care.
